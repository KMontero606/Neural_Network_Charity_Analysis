# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
With the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we will use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
   - Data Preprocessing
     - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
       - The target variable for my model is success rate of applicants funded by Alphabet Soup.
       
     - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
       - The feature variable for my model are all the other category in the dataset (Name, Application type, Affiliation, Classification, Use_case, Organization,      Status, Income amount, Special considerations).
       
     - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
       - the EIN and Ask amount were removed from the input data as it is irrelevant. 

   - Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
     - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
     - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
     - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
